                Hello! My name is Faiz Ahmed. I'm a full stack software developer well conversant with MERN stack. I
                would describe myself as a hybrid taught developer as I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in
                Computer
                Science from The University of Nairobi in 2019 where I learnt the core fundamentals of what it entails
                to be a
                software developer. Over and above this, I have also done a fair share of self learning where I fell in love
                with JavaScript and decided to specialize my tech stack on. I loved the idea of combining visual aspects
                of digital products for my frontend and the technical aspects of it which run behind the scenes for my
                backend. I also have keen eye for UI and UX design. Last but not least, I have also intermediate skills
                with Web3 which i'm so passionate about.

                I'm currently based in Nairobi Kenya, creating digital solutions to make the world a better place. I also
                enjoy networking with fellow creatives across the globe to broaden my thinking spectrum and get the ever
                illusive third eye perspective.

                As an excellent team player, a self driven individual with the ability to follow established procedures
                and work under little or no supervision, I'm currently exploring opportunities in a fast-paced tech
                environment globally to enhance and utilize my well honed skills.
